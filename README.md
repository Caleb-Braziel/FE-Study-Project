Currently functional but need testing:
  - Engineering Economics
  - Heat Transfer*
    - Conduction
    - Convection (working on now)

Created Centroid project first, not yet integrated

Working on Heat Transfer subject. Will be finishing this then testing and finishing engineering economics.
After those, looking to integrate diagrams using matplot library
Then will be working on thermodynamics, then fluid dynamics, statics, dynamics, and so on.

Very later on want to integrate an answer sheet to verify the process of getting each answer (i.e. the equations to use, the thought process, and helpful notes).
