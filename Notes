# This is a sheet of notes while making the FE code

# Will have notes about the code as well as observations when adding the STEM calculations 


# Observations:

#   - You can think of ohms Law as a measurable energy quantity = the rate of energy transfer * the resistance to energy transfer
#       - Voltage (V) = Current (I) * Resistance (R)
#       - Temperature Difference (ΔT) = Rate of Heat Transfer (Q) * Thermal Resistance (Rth)
#       - Pressure Difference (ΔP) = Volumetric Flow Rate (Q) * Flow Resistance (Rf)        (This applies to water and air flow)



# Notes:

# Tkinter Button Command Lambda Functions:
#   - When creating buttons in Tkinter, you can use lambda functions to pass arguments to the command parameter.
#   - This allows you to create buttons that can call functions with specific arguments when clicked.

# Types of Tkinter Widgets Used:
#   - Frame: A container widget that can hold other widgets.
#   - Label: A widget used to display text or images.
#   - Button: A widget that can be clicked to perform an action.
#   - Entry: A widget that allows the user to input text.

# Python Basics:
#   - Can add onto lists using the extend() method.
#       - example_list.extend([item1, item2, item3]) 
#       - Same as:     example_list = example_list + [item1, item2, item3]   
#   - Use math.log() for natural logarithm (base e)
#   - Use math.log10() for base 10 logarithm




# Features to add:

#   - Answer sheet walkthrough maker that shows how to do the problem step by step
#       - May be good to have functions that solve parts of problems that can be called in the walkthrough maker
#            - Would also shorten the functions if these are in seperate files / Functions
#   - Better handling of multi-part questions
#   - Maybe have a way to randomly decide if a question is multi-part or not   
#       - Add units to answers
#   - Toggle between different modes (PDF mode, answer sheet mode, etc)
#   - Add more problems and categories as needed
#   - Add scrollable frames for better navigation through long content
#   - Eventually will need a diagram maker for certain problems that require visual aids (Maybe use matplotlib or PIL for this)
